SIEM = Security Information and Event Management

It’s a system that:

Collects logs from many sources

Correlates events to spot suspicious behavior

Alerts security teams in real time

Stores logs for investigations and compliance

Think of it as a central brain for security logs.

Why SIEM Matters

Without SIEM:

Logs are scattered

Attacks go unnoticed

Investigations take forever

With SIEM:

Faster threat detection

Central visibility

Compliance reporting (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO, etc.)

Core SIEM Components
1. Log Collection

SIEM pulls data from:

Firewalls

IDS/IPS

Servers (Windows/Linux)

Endpoints (EDR)

Applications

Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Methods:

Syslog

Agents

APIs

2. Log Normalization

Different logs → one common format

Example:

Source IP, Destination IP, User, Event Type, Timestamp


This makes correlation possible.

3. Correlation & Detection

SIEM connects events to detect threats.

Examples:

Multiple failed logins → successful login (brute force)

User logs in from two countries in 5 minutes

Malware alert + outbound traffic spike

These are called correlation rules or use cases.

4. Alerts & Dashboards

Real-time alerts for high-risk activity

Dashboards for SOC visibility

Severity levels (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

5. Investigation & Forensics

Search historical logs

Reconstruct timelines

Support incident response

6. Reporting & Compliance

Pre-built compliance reports

Audit trails

Log retention (90 days, 1 year, etc.)

Common SIEM Use Cases

Brute-force attacks

Privilege escalation

Insider threats

Malware infections

Data exfiltration

Account compromise

Popular SIEM Tools

Splunk

IBM QRadar

Microsoft Sentinel

ArcSight

Elastic SIEM

LogRhythm

SIEM vs SOAR (Quick Note)

SIEM → Detects & alerts

SOAR → Automates response (block IP, disable user, etc.)

Many modern SIEMs now include SOAR features.

SIEM Challenges (Real Talk)

Too many false positives

Expensive licensing

Requires tuning

Needs skilled analysts

Good SIEM = good rules + good tuning + good people
